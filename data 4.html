        <p>Vorp or Value Over Replacement Player is an advanced statistic popularized in Baseball circles. The VORP provides a score equal to
            the approximate wins a player contributed to his team compared to a replacement player of average/below average quality in their respective league. 
            VORP hopes to measure the marginal utility of a player. In a comparison of both Jordan and Lebron, several conclusions can be drawn. 
            A- Jordan's career is measured by three large valleys. The first valley was due to broken foot in his second year, leaving him out for most of the year. 
            The second valley came after his retirement in 1993 and his return in 1995. The last valley was due to his second retirement after the 1998 NBA finals. 
            B- Jordan came out and set the league on fire as a rookie. His rookie number dwarfs lebron, although it must be considered that Lebron came to the NBA from highschool. 
            C- The numbers are somewhat of wash. Jordan had a higher peak earlier in his career, while Lebron peaked later. There is no conclusive winner with this metric.
